# Data Wrangling with tidyverse {#tidyverse}

## Welcome to the tidyverse

```{r tidy1, fig.cap="Artwork by Allison Horst", fig.align='center', out.width='80%', echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/tidyverse_celestial.png")
```

The tidyverse is a collection of R packages designed to facilitate data science. 
The so-called *core* tidyverse includes the following packages:

* `dplyr` for data manipulation;
* `tidyr` for tidying data;
* `ggplot2` for plotting;
* `readr` for reading in data files of various formats;
* `stringr` for manipulating character strings;
* `tibble` for a re-engineered alternative to data frames;
* `purrr` for functional programming;
* `forcats` for better handling categorical variables. 

While these are distinct packages and can be installed and loaded separately, 
they share common grammar, syntax, and data structures. Most of the functions we 
are going to see in this and the following Chapter are from `dplyr` and 
`ggplot2`, but we'll sprinkle some `tidyr`, `stringr`, and `tibble` here and 
there. On top of the core packages, there are several other *non-core* 
packages that are installed together with the tidyverse but are not 
automatically loaded. These package are specialized on a few niche roles that
users may not always need. 
  
To install the tidyverse, go ahead and run the following line:

```{r tidy2, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

Then load the package using:

```{r tidy3, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Tidyverse functions

To demonstrate the use of tidyverse functions, we are going to work on the 
dragons dataset we used in Chapters \@ref(relational-databases), 
\@ref(sql), and \@ref(rsqlite). Let's load our data in
using RSQLite like we learned in Chapter \@ref(rsqlite):

```{r tidy4, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
library(DBI)

dragons_db <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "../../Course Material/Data/dragons/dragons.db")
```

And let's load all the tables:

```{r tidy5, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
dragons <- dbGetQuery(dragons_db, "SELECT * FROM dragons;")
capture_sites <- dbGetQuery(dragons_db, "SELECT * FROM capture_sites;")
captures <- dbGetQuery(dragons_db, "SELECT * FROM captures;")
morphometrics <- dbGetQuery(dragons_db, "SELECT * FROM morphometrics;")
diet <- dbGetQuery(dragons_db, "SELECT * FROM diet;")
tags <- dbGetQuery(dragons_db, "SELECT * FROM tags;")
deployments <- dbGetQuery(dragons_db, "SELECT * FROM deployments;")
telemetry <- dbGetQuery(dragons_db, "SELECT * FROM gps_data;")
```

### Subsetting columns

Let's start practicing on the morphometrics table.

```{r tidy6, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
class(morphometrics)
head(morphometrics)
```

We can subset columns of interest from a table using the `select` function. The
function takes as arguments 1. the data and 2. the name/s of one or more 
columns that we want to keep:

```{r tidy7, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
body_wing <- select(morphometrics, dragon_id, date, total_body_length_cm, wingspan_cm)

head(body_wing)
```

The `measurement_id` column is the primary key of the morphometrics table. This
was important to have in the database but we may not want to keep that column
now that we are processing the data in R. We could drop that column by 
selecting all the other ones, but that would be a lot of typing. There is a more 
convenient way: we can use `select` to discard columns by adding a `-` in front
of their name:

```{r tidy8, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
no_pkey <- select(morphometrics, -measurement_id)

head(no_pkey)
```

### Subsetting rows with logical conditions

To subset rows of a table based on certain conditions, we can use the `filter`
function. For example, to filter only wingspans larger than 10 m:

```{r tidy9, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
larger_than_10m <- filter(morphometrics, wingspan_cm > 1000)

head(larger_than_10m)
```

### Concatenating operations with pipes

One of the most revolutionary innovations that the tidyverse brings to R is this
operator: `%>%`, the pipe. A pipe is a connector that allows you to concatenate
subsequent actions into one single chunk of code. For instance, if we wanted to
drop the `measurement_id` column from the morphometrics table **and** filter
rows where `wingspan_cm` is larger than 10 m, this is what we would do without 
the pipe:

```{r tidy10, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
no_pkey <- select(morphometrics, -measurement_id)

larger_than_10m <- filter(no_pkey, wingspan_cm > 1000)

```

Instead, we can concatenate the two actions:

```{r tidy11, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
larger_than_10m <- morphometrics %>% 
  select(-measurement_id) %>% 
  filter(wingspan_cm > 1000)

head(larger_than_10m) 
```

The pipe takes the output of the previous line and feeds it as input into the 
next one. Notice that you don't have to repeat the name of the data object,
because the data is whatever the pipe is feeding into the function. There are 
several advantages to using pipes compared to traditional syntax. First, by 
using a pipe in the example above, we avoided saving intermediate objects (e.g., 
`no_pkey`) to the environment: we only saved the final result we wanted. Second,
we typed less. Third, our code is more readable because the syntax of our code
reflects the logical structure of what we are doing. You can read the pipe as 
*then*: take the morphometrics table, *then* drop the measurement ID, *then*
filter records with wingspan larger than 10 m. The shortcut for inserting a pipe
is `Ctrl + Shift + M` on Windows and `Cmd + Shift + M` on Mac.

### Creating new columns

```{r tidyfig2, fig.cap="Artwork by Allison Horst", fig.align='center', out.width='80%', echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/dplyr_mutate.png")
```

The filtering we did above was pretty inconvenient because we had to calculate 
the conversion between meters and centimeters in our head before applying the
wingspan filter. It would be easier to convert the column to meters to begin
with. We can create a new column using `mutate`:

```{r tidy12, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
larger_than_10m <- morphometrics %>% 
  select(-measurement_id) %>% 
  mutate(wingspan_m = wingspan_cm/100) %>% 
  filter(wingspan_m > 10)

head(larger_than_10m)

```

### Limiting results

I have been saving each of my queries as an object and then doing `head()` to
show the first 6 rows of the result. Instead, I can save myself some typing and
space in my environment (and make everything look cleaner) by adding another 
pipe at the end with the `slice` function. The `slice` function selects rows
based on position, so if I want to look at the first 6 I can do:

```{r tidy13, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
morphometrics %>% 
  select(-measurement_id) %>% 
  mutate(wingspan_m = wingspan_cm/100) %>% 
  filter(wingspan_m > 10) %>% 
  slice(1:6)

```

More generally, `slice` can be used as the equivalent of selecting rows from a
data frame using indexes like we did in Chapter \@ref(intro-to-r). If I want
row 38 of the morphometrics table, I can do:

```{r tidy14, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
morphometrics %>% 
  slice(38)
```

This works with multiple rows too, and they don't need to be consecutive:

```{r tidy15, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
morphometrics %>% 
  slice(c(38, 12, 84))
```

### Tibbles

Another way to limit the output that gets printed to the console is to use 
tibbles instead of data frames. A tibble is tidyverse's data structure for 
tabular data, so it is the tidyverse equivalent of a data frame. Tibbles 
implement some functionalities that make working with them a bit more foolproof
than working with data frames (e.g., they'll return an error instead of `NULL` 
if you try to access a column that does not exist), but 99% of the time you
won't notice the difference. This is because all tidyverse functions (as well as
some base R ones) work just the same with data frames and tibbles. However, 
tibbles do have an advantage: when printing a tibble to the console, only the
first 10 records will show up, which is convenient because it means you don't
need to use `head()` to prevent your console from being flooded with output. 
Case in point:

```{r tiy16, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
morphometrics %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  select(-measurement_id) %>% 
  mutate(wingspan_m = wingspan_cm/100) %>% 
  filter(wingspan_m > 10) 
```

As you can see, the appearance of a tibble is very similar to the one of a 
data frame. In fact, objects can be of multiple classes in R, and tibbles are
also data frames under the hood!

```{r tidy17, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
class(as_tibble(morphometrics))
```

Converting between tibble and data frame is also super easy, so you can switch
back and forth between them whenever you need:

```{r tidy18, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
morph_tib <- as_tibble(morphometrics)
morph_df <- as.data.frame(morph_tib)
```

This last bit is useful to know especially when you are using other packages 
that were not written using tidyverse and strictly require data frames as input. 

### Joining tables 

In Chapter \@ref(sql), we talked about SQL joins. The concept of a join is not
exclusive to SQL, and in fact the tidyverse has functions that serve the same
exact purpose of SQL joins. Let's get familiar with the one you'll use most
often, `left_join`. As a reminder, a left join keeps all the rows of the left
table (the one you mention first) while attaching information from the right 
table (the second one) whenever available. If no information is available, the
columns coming from the right table will have `NA` but the row will be retained. 
To join two tables, these need to share at least one column. Let's join the 
morphometrics table with the dragons table:

```{r tidy19, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
morphometrics %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  left_join(dragons, by = "dragon_id") 
```

In this case the shared column has the same name in the two tables. If it
doesn't, you can still join based on that column. Let's demonstrate how:

```{r tidy20, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
morphometrics %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  rename(dragon = dragon_id) %>% # now the dragon_id column is called "dragon"
  left_join(dragons, by = c("dragon" = "dragon_id")) 
  
```

So the syntax in the `by` argument when the names are different is 
`column_name_in_left_table = column_name_in_right_table`.

### Changing the order of columns 

Incidentally, I have just shown how to change the name of a column by using
`rename`. We can also change the order in which columns appear in our table
using `relocate`. For example, say that we want to move the age class column
to right after the dragon ID:

```{r tidy22, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
morphometrics %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  left_join(dragons, by = "dragon_id") %>%  
  relocate(age_class, .after = dragon_id)
```

### Calculations by group

Now that we know how to join the morphometrics table to the dragons table we can 
calculate some summary statistics based on different groups. To do so, we use
the function `group_by` together with the function `summarize`. For instance,
let's calculate minimum, maximum, and mean tail length for dragons of different
age classes:

```{r tidy23, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
morphometrics %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  left_join(dragons, by = "dragon_id") %>%  
  group_by(age_class) %>% 
  summarize(min_tail_length_cm = min(tail_length_cm),
            mean_tail_length_cm = mean(tail_length_cm),
            max_tail_length_cm = max(tail_length_cm))
```

We can also use `group_by` to count how many records we have for each group.
Let's say we want to know how many dragons of each species we captured:

```{r tidy24, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
morphometrics %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  left_join(dragons, by = "dragon_id") %>%  
  group_by(species) %>%
  tally()
```

### Sorting results

Let's sort results of our count by species in decreasing order:

```{r tidy25, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
morphometrics %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  left_join(dragons, by = "dragon_id") %>%  
  group_by(species) %>%
  tally() %>% 
  arrange(n)
```

Nope, that didn't do it. The species are sorted from the least to the most 
numerous (the default). We need to specify that we want to sort results in 
descending order:

```{r tidy26, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
morphometrics %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  left_join(dragons, by = "dragon_id") %>%  
  group_by(species) %>%
  tally() %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

### Extracting columns as vectors

Now say that we want to only keep morphometric measurements for dragons of 
species for which we have at least 30 individuals. We need to filter those whose 
species falls within that group. So this task can be divided in two steps: 
first, identify the group and store the result; second, filter the table based 
on records from those groups. Let's see:

```{r tidy27, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
(species_over30 <- dragons %>% 
   group_by(species) %>%
   tally() %>% 
   arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
   filter(n > 30) %>% 
   pull(species))
```

The function `pull` at the end extracts the values in my column of interest and
returns them as a vector. 

```{r tidy28, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
class(species_over30) # this is a character vector
```

If I used select instead, the result would be a tibble:

```{r tidy29, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
dragons %>% 
  group_by(species) %>%
  tally() %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  filter(n > 30) %>% 
  select(species)

dragons %>% 
  group_by(species) %>%
  tally() %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  filter(n > 30) %>% 
  select(species) %>% 
  class()
```

Now that we have a vector with the species that we want to retain, we can apply
our filter:

```{r tidy30, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
morphometrics %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  left_join(dragons, by = "dragon_id") %>% 
  filter(species %in% species_over30)
```

### Conditional value assignment

```{r tidyfig3, fig.cap="Artwork by Allison Horst", fig.align='center', out.width='80%', echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/dplyr_case_when.png")
```

The last function we are going to look at is `case_when`. This function allows
to do conditional value assignment by vectorizing multiple statements of the 
kind: `if` ... `else` .... Let's look at an example to understand what this 
means. The dragons table includes information on sex and on age class. Say that
we wanted to create a composite variable combining sex and age class, with
possible categories "adult female", "adult male", "juvenile female", etc. We can
gather the information from the two existing column and create a new column 
assigning the appropriate category to each individual using `case_when`:

```{r tidy31, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
morphometrics %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  left_join(dragons, by = "dragon_id") %>% 
  mutate(sex_age_combo = case_when(
    sex == "F" & age_class == "Adult" ~ "Adult Female",
    sex == "M" & age_class == "Adult" ~ "Adult Male",
    sex == "F" & age_class == "Subadult" ~ "Subadult Female",
    sex == "M" & age_class == "Subadult" ~ "Subadult Male",
    sex == "F" & age_class == "Juvenile" ~ "Juvenile Female",
    sex == "M" & age_class == "Juvenile" ~ "Juvenile Female",
    is.na(sex) & age_class == "Adult" ~ "Adult Unknown",
    is.na(sex) & age_class == "Subadult" ~ "Subadult Unknown",
    is.na(sex) & age_class == "Juvenile" ~ "Juvenile Unknown"
    )) %>% 
  select(dragon_id, sex, age_class, sex_age_combo)
```

Let's break down the syntax I used in the `case_when` statement. Each entry has
the form *logical condition* ~ *value to assign*. Let's isolate the left-hand 
side of the first entry:

```{r tidy32, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
head(dragons$sex == "F" & dragons$age_class == "Adult")
```

There can be as many entries as we want, but they should fully cover the
logical domain of the statement. In other words, we need to account for every 
possibility. If, say, we left out the male subadult combination, `case_when` is
going to automatically assign `NA`:

```{r tidy33, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
morphometrics %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  left_join(dragons, by = "dragon_id") %>% 
  mutate(sex_age_combo = case_when(
    sex == "F" & age_class == "Adult" ~ "Adult Female",
    sex == "M" & age_class == "Adult" ~ "Adult Male",
    sex == "F" & age_class == "Subadult" ~ "Subadult Female",
    sex == "F" & age_class == "Juvenile" ~ "Juvenile Female",
    sex == "M" & age_class == "Juvenile" ~ "Juvenile Female",
    is.na(sex) & age_class == "Adult" ~ "Adult Unknown",
    is.na(sex) & age_class == "Subadult" ~ "Subadult Unknown",
    is.na(sex) & age_class == "Juvenile" ~ "Juvenile Unknown"
    )) %>% 
  select(dragon_id, sex, age_class, sex_age_combo)
```

Once we've covered all of the possibilities except one, we can leave the last
one implicit by using `TRUE` on the left-hand side of the last entry of the
`case_when` statement. For example, if an individual does not fall in the first 
six categories it means its sex is unknown. We could lump these all together in
one "Unknown" category: 

```{r tidy34, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
morphometrics %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  left_join(dragons, by = "dragon_id") %>% 
  mutate(sex_age_combo = case_when(
    sex == "F" & age_class == "Adult" ~ "Adult Female",
    sex == "M" & age_class == "Adult" ~ "Adult Male",
    sex == "F" & age_class == "Subadult" ~ "Subadult Female",
    sex == "M" & age_class == "Subadult" ~ "Subadult Male",
    sex == "F" & age_class == "Juvenile" ~ "Juvenile Female",
    sex == "M" & age_class == "Juvenile" ~ "Juvenile Female",
    TRUE ~ "Unknown"
    )) %>% 
  select(dragon_id, sex, age_class, sex_age_combo)
```

Or we could decide that if sex is unknown we just simply assign the value of
`age_class`:

```{r tidy35, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
morphometrics %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  left_join(dragons, by = "dragon_id") %>% 
  mutate(sex_age_combo = case_when(
    sex == "F" & age_class == "Adult" ~ "Adult Female",
    sex == "M" & age_class == "Adult" ~ "Adult Male",
    sex == "F" & age_class == "Subadult" ~ "Subadult Female",
    sex == "M" & age_class == "Subadult" ~ "Subadult Male",
    sex == "F" & age_class == "Juvenile" ~ "Juvenile Female",
    sex == "M" & age_class == "Juvenile" ~ "Juvenile Female",
    TRUE ~ age_class
    )) %>% 
  select(dragon_id, sex, age_class, sex_age_combo)
```

## Style

Tidyverse syntax helps to make code readable, but half of the deal with 
readability has to do with style. Hadley Whickham, the inventor of the tidyverse,
has put together a handy [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) that lists
things to pay attention to when writing code and best practices to adopt. Style
is not so much about making things aesthetically pleasing (although it certainly
does), but about making the code easy for your eyes to navigate through and 
understand. R already uses a type of font for which each character occupies the
same amount of pixels, which makes things align nicely across rows. This makes 
it easy to recognize structure in the code at a glance, and this physical 
structure corresponds to logical structure so it helps you understand how the
pieces fit together. But these qualities are no good if the user doesn't put in
the effort to take advantage of them. Here are my favorite style tips to make 
sure your code looks clean and reads easily:

* Always put spaces after your commas, on both sides of equal signs and other
operators (e.g., do `x <- 1`, not `x<-1`);
* Do not exceed 80 characters per line in your script (you can check how many
characters you've used at the bottom-left corner of the script panel, and recent
versions of RStudio also have a handy gray vertical line that marks the 80 
character limit);
* Be consistent in your variable names: don't use `CamelCase` for some and 
`lowercase_with_underscores` for others. Actually, stick to `lowercase_with_underscores`.
* Start a new line after each pipe `%>%`;
* I like to start a new line even after each column listed in a `select` 
statement, or even after each argument of a function (for sure whenever the code 
would overflow past 80 characters otherwise);
* Tidyverse automatically indents your code when you go to a new line (e.g., 
after a pipe), but if you happen to mess with the alignment while you're editing 
the code, make sure to reindent it and realign it at the end (you don't have to
do it manually, just highlight the chunk of code you want to reindent and go to
*Code* > *Reindent lines* in RStudio, or press `Ctrl` + `I`).
